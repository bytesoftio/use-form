## Description

This package provides a very convenient abstraction for forms. I never liked the idea of forms being
defined and handled entirely inside React components, so I came up with this approach.

A form should be a first class citizen inside a project, kinda like a service. It should:

- Have an initial state
- Have a way to reset to initial state
- Have validation logic
- Have a handler
- Have things like loading indicators, dirty fields, etc.
- Have an easy way to bind to input elements
- Be typed properly 

Form logic consists mainly of these steps: 

- Define form data structure
- Provide initial state
- Define validation logic
- Define handler logic
- Provide status messages from within a handler like success, error, etc.
- Share form submission result

A form with all of these things should be treated like a regular service, 
it has no place inside a presentation component. A component should simply bind
form data to according input elements, consume validation errors and status messages,
block form during submission and other purely presentation related stuff.

If you agree at least with some of the points above, stay with me, this library totally 
changed how I work with forms and might change your approach as well.

## Quick start

Let's create a very simple form, where you can create a new user through an api call, with validation, etc. 
Keep in mind that this example could be much shorter in terms of lines of code It all depends on 
how much types you want to write. I always try to use as precise types as possible, so there is some boilerplate
code around. I think it totally pays off in the long run though.

```ts
// types.ts

// sample data type that you want to create through an api call
export type User = {
  uuid: string
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
}

// this is what the form looks like
export type CreateUserForm = {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
}

// meaningful feedback for form consumers
export type CreateUserResult = {
  success?: string
  error?: string
  user?: User
}
```

```ts
// api.ts

import { User, CreateUserForm } from "./types"

// simulate api call for demo purposes
const createUser = async (data: CreateUserForm): Promise<User> => ({ id: 1, ...data })
```

```ts
// form.ts

import { createForm } from "@bytesoftio/use-form/src"
import { object, string } from "@bytesoftio/schema"
import { CreateUserForm, CreateUserResult } from "./types"
import { createUser } from "./api.ts"

// a dedicated form factory
export const createUserForm = () => {
  // create a new form with initial state
  return createForm<CreateUserForm, CreateUserResult>({
    firstName: "",
    lastName: ""
  })
    // using @bytesoftio/schema package for validation
    .schema(object({
      firstName: string().min(2).max(20),
      lastName: string().min(2).max(20)
    }))
    // add form handling logic
    .handler(async (form) => {
      try {
        // pretend to make an api call here 
        const user = await createUser(form.data.get())

        form.result.set({ success: "User created", user })
      } catch (error) {
        form.result.set({ error: "Could not create user" })
      }
    })
}
```

```tsx
// component.tsx

import React from "react"
import { useForm } from "@bytesoftio/use-form"
import { createUserForm } from "./form.ts"

const CreateUserForm = () => {
  // create a new form instance and consume it for proper re-renders when state changes
  const form = useForm(createUserForm)
  // grab what you need from various state objects
  const [errors, result] = [form.errors, form.result.get()]

  return (
    <form {...form.bind.form()}>
      <div>{result?.success || result?.error }</div>

      <div>
        <input {...form.bind.input("firstName")} placeholder="First name"/>
        <div>{errors.getAt("firstName")}</div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <input {...form.bind.input("lastName")} placeholder="Last name"/>
        <div>{errors.getAt("lastName")}</div>
      </div>

      <button {...form.bind.button()}>Create</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

## Form config

Form behaviour can be altered through several config options:

```ts
import { createForm } from "@bytesoftio/use-form"

const form = createForm({})
	.configure({
    // run validation whenever from state changes
    validateOnChange: true,
    // if validateOnChange is set to true, define whether all fields should
    // be validated or only those that have been changed through user input
    validateChangedFieldsOnly: false,
    // run validattions before submitting form
    validateOnSubmit: true
  })
```

## Form data

All the form data is stored inside the `form.data` object. It comes with a few convenient helper methods.

```ts
import { createForm } from "@bytesoftio/use-form"

const initialState = { field1: "", field2: "", field3: "" }
const form = createForm(initialState)

// retrieve all of the form data
form.data.get()

// replace all form data with new one
form.data.set({ field1: "foo", field2: "bar" })

// add / replace some of the data with new one
form.data.add({ field3: "baz" })

// reset data back to its initial state
form.data.reset()

// alternatively you can provide new state that should be used as initialState
form.data.reset({ field1: "-", field2: "-", field3: "-" })

// retrieve a spefcific form field value
form.data.getAt("path.to.field")

// replace a specific form field value
form.data.setAt("path.to.field", "value")

// check if form has a certain value
form.data.hasAt("path.to.field")
```

## Validation logic

Form can be validated in several ways. Mostly you'll want to use the `schema` method. It takes as schema description object produced by the `@bytesoftio/schema` package. But it is also possible to provide a custom validation function.

Lets take a look at the custom validate function first. A validation function can be `sync` or `async` and must return either `undefined` / nothing in case of a successful validation, or an error object of type `ValidationResult` that you can find in the `@bytesoftio/schema` package.

```tsx
import { createForm } from "@bytesoftio/use-form"

const form = createForm({ 
  title: "", 
  user: { firstName: "" }
})
	.validator(async (form) => {
    const data = form.data.get()
    
    // some validation logic ...
    
    return {
      title: ["Value missing"],
      "user.firstName": ["Value missing"]
    }
  })
```

Additionaly it is possible to provide a validation schema powered by the very easy to use `@bytesoftio/schema` package.

```ts
import { createForm } from "@bytesoftio/use-form"
import { object, string } from "@bytesoftio/schema"

const form = createForm({ 
  title: "", 
  user: { firstName: "" }
})
	.schema(object({
    title: string().between(3, 50),
    user: object({ firstName: string().between(3, 50) })
  }))
```

## Validation and errors

A form can be validated manually, before submission, using the `validate` method. The result is either `undefined`, in case of a successful validation, or an error object of type `ValidationResult`, from the `@bytesoftio/schema` package.

```ts
import { createForm } from "@bytesoftio/use-form"

const form = createForm({})
const errors = await form.validate()

if ( ! errors) {
  // submit form ...
}
```

Form can be configured to validate only the changed fields, or validate immediately on user input, etc. Take a look at [form config](#form-config) section. 

You can validate changed fields only without configuring the form, by providing a specific flag.

```ts
form.validate({ changedFieldsOnly: true })
```

When submitting a form, validations are run atomatically, unless configured otherwise.

You can access form errors anytime trough `form.errors` property. The errors object has many convenience method when dealing with errors.

```ts
// get all validation errors
form.errors.get()

// replace old errors with new one
form.errors.set({ firstName: ["Value is missing"] })

// add some new errors, but keep the old ones
form.errors.add({ firstName: ["Value is missing"] })

// are there any errors, returns boolean
form.errors.has()

// clear all errors
form.errors.clear()

// get errors for a specific field
form.errors.getAt("path.to.field")

// replace old errors with the new ones for a specific field
form.errors.setAt("path.to.field", ["New error"])

// add new errors for a specific field, but keep the old ones
form.errors.addAt("path.to.field", "New error")
form.errors.addAt("path.to.field", ["New error1", "New error2"])

// check if there are errors for specific fields
form.errors.hasAt("path.to.field")
form.errors.hasAt(["path.to.field1"], "path.to.field2")

// clear errors for specific fields
form.errors.clearAt("path.to.field")
form.errors.clearAt(["path.to.field1", "path.to.field2"])
```

## Submit form and provide feedback

To submit a form to an API you need to provide a form handler. This piece of logic is responsible for extracting form data, sending data to an endpoint, handling remote errors, providing meaningful feedback to the form consumers / presentation layer.

```ts
import { createForm } from "@bytesoftio/use-form"

const form = createForm()
	.handler(async form => {
		try {
      const result = await sendFormData(form.data.get())
      
     	form.result.set({ success: "Data sent succefully", result })
    } catch (error) {
      form.result.set({ error: "Could not send data" })
    }
  })
```

To provide meaningful feedback to form consumers you can use the `form.result` object. Any kind of feedback coming from a form handler, except validation messages, should go into the `form.result` object, those might be things like status messages, data received from an endpoint after creating an entity on the remote, etc. Everything can be statically typed, take a look at [quick start](#quick-start) to learn more about this.

When submitting a form, validations are run automatically, you can prevent this by configuring the form accordingly, see [form config](#form-config), or setting a flag.

```ts
form.submit({ validate: false })
```

## Reset form state

You can reset all of the form state back to its initial value as well as all the errors, dirty fields, results, etc.

```ts
import { createForm } from "@bytesoftio/use-form"

const form = createForm({ field1: "foo", field2: "bar" })

// reset form
form.reset()

// reset form and provide a new initial state
form.reset({ field1: "", field2: ""})
```



## Dirty fields and changed fields

You can check if any specific field has been changed through user input. There is a differentiation between `diryFields` and `changedFields`. As soon as a form field has been changed, for example from `""` to `"foo"` - it becomes dirty. If the field changes back to `""`, it is still dirty. `changedFields` works slightly different. A field is changed only if the value is actually different from the initial one. So a field can be dirty and *not* changed at the same time.

`dirtyFields` and  `changedFields` have both the same interface `HookFormFields`. 

```ts
import { createForm } from "@bytesoftio/use-form"

const form = createForm({})

// grab all dirty fields, returns an array of strings[]
form.dirtyFields.get()

// check if on or multiple fields are dirty, returns boolean
form.dirtyFields.has("field")
form.dirtyFields.has(["field1", "path.to.field2"])

// replace old dirty fields with new opnes
form.dirtyFields.set(["field1", "path.to.field2"])

// add additional dirty fields to the existing ones
form.dirtyFields.add("field1")
form.dirtyFields.add(["field1", "path.to.field2"])

// remove some dirty fields
form.dirtyFields.remove("field1")
form.dirtyFields.remove(["field1", "path.to.field2"])

// clear all fields
form.dirtyfields.clear()

// get notified whenever dirty fields change
form.dirtyFields.listen((fields) => console.log(fields))
```

Once again, the `form.changedFields` object is absolutely identical, in terms of interface, to the `form.dirtyFields` one. There is no need for additional docs here.

## Status indicators

Sometimes you'll need a flag to tell if form is currently being submitted, or has already been submitted. In this case you can use one of these status objects: `form.submitting` or `form.submitted`. Both implement the `HookValue` interface that comes from the `@bytesoftio/use-value` package and has all the relevant docs.

```ts
// is form currently being submitted, returns boolean
form.submitting.get()
// has form already been submitted, returns boolean
form.submitted.get()
```

## Form hooks and bindings

For a React component to properly update upon form state changes, you must first hook the form up. There are several ways on how to consume forms in components.

After consuming a form you must bind it to input fields. This library already ships with a very lightweight binder inside, but you can very easily roll your own binder for your specific ui library, like Antd for example.. Just take a look on how `FormBinder`  is written - its easy as cacke.

Lets take a look on how to use hooks and bindings:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import { createForm, useForm } from "@bytesoftio/use-form"

const specialFormFactory = () => createForm()
const sharedFormInstance = createForm()

const Component = () => {
  const formFromFactory = useForm(specialFormFactory)
  const sharedForm = useForm(sharedFormInstance)
  const formFromInlineFactory = useForm(() => createForm())
  const inlineForm = useForm(inlineForm())
  
	return (
    <form { ...form.bind.form() }>
    	<input type="text" { ...form.bind.input("field1") } />
    	
      <input type="checkbox" { ...form.bind.checkbox("field2") } />
      
      <input type="radio" { ...form.bind.radio("field3", "value1") } />
      <input type="radio" { ...form.bind.radio("field3", "value2") } />
      
      <select { ...form.bind.select("field4") }>
        <option>option 1</option>
        <option>option 2<option>
        <option>option 3<option>
      </select>
          
      <button { ...form.bind.submit() }>Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```
